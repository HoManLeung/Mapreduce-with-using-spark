The objective of this assignment is using spark to perform mapreduce algorithm, same with last assignment, as I download the raw data from the internet and the website only allow to download the dataset from 2003 to 2019.

In this assignment I am using googlecolab to perform the analysis. The reason I use google colab because it have larger capacity compared with databrick.

I use pyspark.sql to perform the output and make sure the algorithm is work exactly the same with pyspark.sql output.
I use pyspark map function and reducebykey function to perform this algorthm, the function is more simplify compare with just using python to do mapreduce algorithm.
